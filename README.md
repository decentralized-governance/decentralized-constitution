# The DeGov Constitution
After the events of [ConstitutionDAO](https://www.constitutiondao.com/), it's time we all work together to construct a Decentralized Governance (DeGov) Constitution for the People of the World, online and off, that we can all live by and adopt personally.

## Current Draft
There's a [Constitution.md](https://github.com/markthepixel/decentralized-constitution/blob/main/Constitution.md) file in this repo that will act as a holding place for The DeGov Constitution until such a time we all agree otherwise.

## Appending and Changes
1. Let's use Pull Requests and discuss a way to better decentralize the writing of this document.
2. Discuss are taking place today in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/p2jdESeVfy), we encourage you to join.

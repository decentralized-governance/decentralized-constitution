## Abstract
To create equality, balance, and accountability among the People of the world. This organization, built on the evolving foundations of Web3, exists to educate and set examples for practicing decentralized governance (DeGov) amongst one another.

We the People, who are from all walks, all backgrounds, and all welfares unite under a common goal of decentralized governance to build a strong future. We each pledge to withhold, practice, and demonstrate the DeGov guiding principles and structures across all projects weâ€™re involved in, as well as in all facets of our lives, both on and off chain.

The DeGov Constitution outlines a specific set of rights and responsibilities for the three pillars of DeGov. These three pillars are the contributory, the communal, and the technological. These are meant to represent the people who contribute, those who choose to participate, and the technologies we use.
